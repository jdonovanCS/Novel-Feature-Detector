optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dataset DATASET     which dataset should be used for novelty metric, choices are: cifar-10, cifar-100
  --experiment_name EXPERIMENT_NAME
                        experiment name for saving data related to training
  --fixed_conv          Should the convolutional layers stay fixed, or alternatively be trained
  --training_interval TRAINING_INTERVAL
                        How often should the network be trained. Values should be supplied as a fraction and will
                        relate to the generations from evolutionFor example if 1 is given the filters generated from
                        the final generation of evolution will be the only ones trained. If 0.5 is given then the
                        halfway point of evolutionary generations and the final generation will be trained. If 0 is
                        given, the filters from every generation will be trained
